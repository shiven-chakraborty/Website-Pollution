# Website-Pollution
This is a website which I made for an entry in the Coolest Projects 2022 event!

IMPORTANT!!!
To run the website perfectly, kindly do the following steps carefully - 
1) In the videos file, download the videos from the links attatched
2) After downloading the videos, kindly open your Text Editor or IDE and write the location of the videos by replacing the location which is written there. The place to put the video location is Line 18,19 and 20
3) If having any errors, kindly mail me at shiven.chakraborty@gmail.com
